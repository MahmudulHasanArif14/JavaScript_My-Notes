// is js we can declare variable with var,let,const but new modern age we don't use var because if we use it we can declare same name variable more than one time so that why we generally use let keyword without any keyword we all can declare variable it automatically can detect which type of var it is

var age=5;
var age=10;
var age=12;// here is a problem we use age declare it multiple time so it will create multiple age name variable

let id=1;
 id=2;// with let we can't redeclare but update the value 


const pi=3.14; // when we use const keyword then we have to assign some value to it so it is a constant 

inputtake=prompt("Enter A number");//works like alert
